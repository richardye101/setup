Creating a setup guide for myself to remember how I setup wireguard at home.

# Required software

- duckdns (working for me now, but i've heard DynuDNS is also good), for example: mydns.duckdns.org
- wireguard on the server, usually installed on linux like so:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install wireguard
```

- wireguard on all the clients, I installed it on Mac and iOS through the app store.

# Setup server

1. On the server, create a folder to store all the setup configs:

```
mkdir ~/wireguard
```

2. Create a public/private key pair for the SERVER:

```
cd ~/wireguard
( umask 0077 && wg genkey | tee privatekey-server | wg pubkey > publickey-server )
```

3. Identify the interface being used for the server's LAN IP (assuming linux):

```
ip a
```

The result looks something like this:

```
me@debian:~/wireguard$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: ens18: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether bc:24:11:7a:ba:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp0s18
    altname enxbc24117abade
    inet 192.168.0.2/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute ens18
       valid_lft 54509sec preferred_lft 43709sec
    inet6 fe80::bcb1:add3:c256:194d/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

So my LAN IP is `192.168.0.2` and my interface is `ens18`

4. Create a `~/wireguard/wg0-server.conf` file, replace `<INTERFACE>` with your interface, `<PRIVATEKEY-SERVER>` with your server private key:

```
[Interface]
Address=10.0.0.1/8 # Make sure this private address range is not in use.
SaveConfig=true
PostUp=iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o <INTERFACE> -j MASQUERADE;
PostDown=iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o <INTERFACE> -j MASQUERADE;
ListenPort=51820 # Standard port for WireGuard
PrivateKey=<PRIVATEKEY-SERVER>
```

5. Move the `wg0-server.conf` to `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`:

```
sudo cp wg0-server.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

6. Allow packets to be port-forwarded to WireGuard:

```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

7. Bring up the wireguard interface `wg0`:

```
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

# Setup client (Mac)

1. With Wireguard installed, click `+` -> `Add empty tunnel...`

2. You will see already generated Public and Private Key pair. Note them down, i stored them on the server at `~/wireguard/publickey-mac` and `~/wireguard/privatekey-mac`.

3. Fill out the text box like so:

```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <PREPOPULATED-PRIVATE-KEY>
Address = 10.0.0.2/8 # replace the 2 with any number between 3-255 for additional clients

[Peer]
PublicKey = <PUBLICKEY-SERVER>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32
Endpoint = <PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 60
```

The PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS will be the DuckDNS domain you obtained earlier (`mydns.duckdns.org`).
You can alternatively get the PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS at whatismyipaddress.com, which is the public IP for your entire home network. This may change though, so I'd recommend setting up Duck/Dynu DNS.

4. On the server, you'll need to add this client as a peer, append this at the bottom of your `wg0-server.conf`:

```
[Peer]
PublicKey = <PUBLICKEY-MAC>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
```

5. Move the `wg0-server.conf` to `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`:

```
sudo cp wg0-server.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

7. Restart the WireGuard interface:

```
sudo wg-quick down wg0
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

# Setup client (iPhone)

1. Install WireGuard
2. Generate a public/private key pair (with the same command as the server key generation)
3. Create a `wg0-iphone.conf` file. I used [the WireGuard QR Code Generator](https://www.wireguardconfig.com/qrcode) to convert the following into a QR code for my phone:

```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <PRIVATEKEY-IPHONE>
Address = 10.0.0.3/8

[Peer]
PublicKey = <PUBLICKEY-SERVER>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32
Endpoint = mydns.duckdns.org:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 60
```

4. Scan the QR code on WireGuard installed on the phone

5. On the server, you'll need to add this phone as a peer, append this at the bottom of your `wg0-server.conf`:

```
[Peer]
PublicKey = <PUBLICKEY-IPHONE>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32
```

6. Move the `wg0-server.conf` to `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`:

```
sudo cp wg0-server.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

7. Restart the WireGuard interface:

```
sudo wg-quick down wg0
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

# Setup client (linux)

You get the drill at this point I think:

1. Install WireGuard
2. Generate a public/private key pair (with the same command as the server key generation)
3. Create a `wg0-client.conf` for the client, and place in the client's `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`. Looks like so:

```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <PRIVATEKEY-CLIENT>
Address = 10.0.0.4/8
SaveConfig = true

[Peer]
PublicKey = <PUBLICKEY-SERVER>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32
Endpoint = mydns.duckdns.org:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 60
```

4. Startup wireguard interface:

```
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

5. On the server, you'll need to add this client as a peer, append this at the bottom of your `wg0-server.conf`:

```
[Peer]
PublicKey = <PUBLICKEY-CLIENT>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.4/32
```

6. Move the `wg0-server.conf` to `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`:

```
sudo cp wg0-server.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

7. Restart the WireGuard interface:

```
sudo wg-quick down wg0
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```
